"""Team-scoped booking storage backed by Agent Platform Memory Bank.

Calls the API directly rather than via ADK's memory service, which cannot do
either half: ``ToolContext.add_memory`` scopes writes with the *session's*
``user_id`` (whichever caller invoked us, not a constant team scope), and
``search_memory`` is similarity-only where listing needs
``retrieve(simple_retrieval_params=...)``.
