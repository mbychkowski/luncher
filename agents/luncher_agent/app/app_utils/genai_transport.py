"""An httpx transport that reaches Agent Runtime through the genai client.

Under Agent Identity the credential is bound, so a bearer header built from ADC
is 401'd and no IAM grant helps -- the fix is the transport, not the credential.
Exposing the genai client's ``_api_client.request()`` as a transport keeps card
resolution, the JSON-RPC envelope and part conversion in ADK's ``RemoteA2aAgent``.

Agent Runtime peers only; Cloud Run wants an audience-bound ID token -- see
``GoogleAuth`` in ``app.agent``.
