# 🚀 Luncher: Cloud Run GHA & Terraform Deployment Blueprint

Welcome to **Luncher**! This repository is a premium, fully-featured, production-ready blueprint for implementing high-quality CI/CD pipelines to Google Cloud (GCP) using **GitHub Actions**, **Terraform**, **Workload Identity**, **Cloud Build**, and **Google Cloud Run**.

Designed specifically for **forkable deployments**, this template empowers developers or different organizations to fork this codebase, inject their own credentials, and seamlessly spin up their own secure environments in Google Cloud with **all resource lifecycle management handled fully by Terraform**.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The deployment architecture ensures secure, modern, and best-practice patterns:

1. **Secure Auth via Workload Identity**: No long-lived GCP service account keys (`JSON` files) are stored in GitHub. We use keyless OpenID Connect (OIDC) through Google Cloud Workload Identity Pools.
2. **Automated Infrastructure (Terraform)**: GCS Remote backend stores our state securely. Terraform acts as the single source of truth, managing:
   - An Artifact Registry repository (`luncher-repo`) for our container images.
   - The Cloud Run service (`luncher-service`) with secure configurations.
   - Public IAM permissions to allow unauthenticated web visitors.
3. **Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)**:
   - Built on-demand using Google Cloud Build (which avoids having to expose Docker daemons in GitHub runners).
   - Deployed directly and securely to **Google Cloud Run** by passing the newly compiled container image tag straight into a `terraform apply` step.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Code & Pipeline Management**: GitHub Actions & GitHub CLI (`gh`)
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform (`>= 1.6.0`)
- **Container Registry**: GCP Artifact Registry
- **Serverless Hosting**: Google Cloud Run
- **Container Compilation**: GCP Cloud Build
- **Application Logic**: Python Flask & Gunicorn microservice

## 🚀 Getting Started: Initializing Your Project

Follow these steps to instantiate your own copy of the project and deploy it to your Google Cloud environment.

### 📌 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed and authenticated on your local machine (or use **Google Cloud Shell**, which comes with all of these pre-installed):

1. [Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI)](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
2. [GitHub CLI (gh)](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation)
3. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

---

### Step 1: Fork and Clone the Repository

1. **Fork** this repository to your own GitHub account or organization.
2. **Clone** your fork locally and navigate into the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME-OR-ORG/luncher.git
cd luncher
```

3. **Authenticate** your command line tools:

```bash
# Authenticate gcloud CLI
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login

# Authenticate GitHub CLI (strongly recommended to auto-populate GH Actions variables)
gh auth login
```

---

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables (`01-setup-env.sh`)

Initialize your local configuration by running the interactive setup script. This script will inspect your current active `gcloud` and `git` status to guess sensible defaults, prompt you for confirmation, and save them to a `.env` file.

```bash
./scripts/01-setup-env.sh
```

During this step, you will be prompted for:
- **GitHub owner/organization** (your GitHub username/org name)
- **GitHub repository name** (e.g. `luncher`)
- **GCP project ID** (the Google Cloud project you wish to deploy to)
- **GCP region** (defaults to `us-central1`)

---

### Step 3: Enable Google Cloud APIs (`02-init-api.sh`)

Enable all of the required Google Cloud API services in your target GCP project:

```bash
./scripts/02-init-api.sh
```

---

### Step 4: Setup Workload Identity & Service Account (`03-setup-github-actions.sh`)

This script creates a secure GCP service account, initializes a global Workload Identity Pool, configures an OIDC provider mapped specifically to your GitHub fork, and **automates the setting of GitHub Actions Repository Variables** using the `gh` CLI!

```bash
./scripts/03-setup-github-actions.sh
```

> [!NOTE]
> If your `gh` CLI is not authenticated, the script will output the exact key-value variables for you to copy and paste manually into your GitHub Repository settings (**Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Variables**).

---

### Step 5: Grant IAM Permissions (`04-setup-iam.sh`)

Grant your newly created GitHub Actions Service Account the minimum-privilege IAM roles required to provision and manage network, storage, and serverless resources:

```bash
./scripts/04-setup-iam.sh
```

---

### Step 6: Create State Bucket & Configure tfvars (`05-setup-tf.sh`)

Create the Google Cloud Storage bucket used to store your Terraform remote state file securely, copy `terraform/terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform/terraform.tfvars`, and automatically inject your configured environment values:

```bash
./scripts/05-setup-tf.sh
```

---

## 🏗️ Deployment Walkthrough

Once your environment is configured, the rest of the deployment is managed entirely through **GitHub Actions** in your fork!

### 📡 Phase 1: Deploy Infrastructure

1. Navigate to the **Actions** tab of your forked GitHub repository.
2. Select the **Terraform Deployment** workflow from the sidebar.
3. Click the **Run workflow** dropdown and trigger the workflow on the `main` branch.
4. This workflow will authenticate via Workload Identity, initialize Terraform pointing to your secure GCS bucket, and provision:
   - An Artifact Registry Docker repository (`luncher-repo`).
   - A secure Google Cloud Run service (`luncher-service`) pre-initialized with a standard public hello-world placeholder image.
   - Fully open public IAM ingress bindings so the service is unauthenticated.

---

### 📦 Phase 2: Build & Deploy Application

Once your infrastructure is ready, you can build and deploy your customized Flask application:

1. In the **Actions** tab, select the **Continuous Delivery** workflow.
2. Click **Run workflow** and trigger the deployment.
3. This workflow will:
   - Authenticate to your GCP project.
   - Run a Cloud Build trigger inside GCP to securely compile and tag the Python container.
   - Push the container image to your Artifact Registry.
   - Execute a `terraform apply` step, passing the newly compiled container image path into your Terraform configurations, updating the Cloud Run container securely, and providing your live public URL!

## 🧼 Cleanup

To avoid ongoing charges, you can easily tear down all of the resources deployed in Google Cloud:

1. Go to your GitHub Fork's **Actions** tab.
2. Select the **Terraform DESTROY** workflow.
3. Click **Run workflow** and run it to automatically delete all Artifact Registry resources, public IAM bindings, and active Cloud Run service deployments in a single step!
